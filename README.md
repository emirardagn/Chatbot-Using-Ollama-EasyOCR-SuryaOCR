- **Content Summarization**: The extracted content is summarized by the AI model, providing a concise overview.
- **Chat Interface**: Users can interact with the chatbot to ask questions about the document content.
- **Flask Backend**: The backend is built using Flask, handling file uploads, OCR processing, and chatbot interactions.
- **Customizable Models**: Users can choose different AI models for summarization and question answering.
